# Alexa Skills

Some Alexa skills made by me just for fun.  

## Skills

* Memes - ask alexa for a meme (in portuguese).  
* Learning to count (aprendendo-a-contar) - learn to count up to 50 with alexa - for kids (in portuguese)
* Today's dollar (dolar-hoje) - ask Alexa for today's dollar currency from USD to BRL

# Usage

1. Host on AWS Lambda or your own hosting provider the code inside ``lambda`` folder
2. Go to Alexa's developer console, create a new skill and upload ``intents.json`` or ``skill.json`` and ``interactionModels`` (if any) in JSON editor section.
